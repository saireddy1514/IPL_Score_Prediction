- <b><i>Process:</i></b>

I developed a machine learning algorithm that predicts team scores with an accuracy of 72%. I trained the algorithm using 76,015 records and created a pickle file to use it in web applications. I created a Flask application that allows users to input certain parameters which are then sent to the ML algorithm to produce a predicted accuracy score range. I display the result on the frontend.

These are the parameters that Iam taking for predicting the score.
